/// \brief file for leaning HTML 5
/// 
/// I will use this file to learn HTML 5 by implementing several of the new 
///   elements into a game.  I want to particularly use local storage, svg, 
///   canvas, javascript, web workers...
/// 
/// I want to create a type of 'Artillery' clone.  It will star trebuchets as the 
///   weapon.  You will have to mine the stone you use.  And you can build 
///   fortifications.  Ideally I will use SVG for the 'sprites' and canvas for 
///   the background and artillery.
/// 
/// You will start with 1 worker (to mine and load your trebuchet) and you will 
///   be able to add to your work force with 'points' (to be earned by wins or 
///   milestones ... both ???).  Eventually I would like to make it so you can 
///   upgrade your trebuchet (wheels, more weight capacity ...) through the 
///   points as well.  I want to make it so there can be one or two players.
/// 
/// I would like to port this to smart phones too using 
///   'PhoneGap' and maybe 'Rhomoble'
