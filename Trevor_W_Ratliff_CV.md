# Trevor Ratliff - General Programmer

## INTRO STATEMENT
I've been a professional programmer since 2000 with 3D animation, photography, and film backgrounds ... but that doesn't really say much. I'm a creative person, so much so that I have a hard time purchasing things because I either know how to make it already or I can figure it out pretty quick. Some of my recent projects have been a camera shoulder sling, moccasins for my baby and a kilt that I wear regularly - bifurcated clothing just wasn't meant for men ;-) ... but that doesn't tell anyone about my programming abilities, though those skills help greatly with programming tasks.

My love of programming can be traced back to when I was 5 years old and learning how origami transformed a flat piece of paper into amazing things. Things like frogs that could jump or human figures with 5 fingers on each hand that I would design later in life. So much versatility in one simple form. Origami lead to sewing toys, both lead to an active imagination which lead to videography in high school - where I could let others see what I imagined. I used my creative skills in providing effects for the video's I helped make - things like hanging actors so they appeared to have been hung by a noose. I also spent a lot of time behind the camera as the main camera-man which lead to photography and 3D animation. During my pursuit of special effects for the videos I was making I learned about programming, and I fell in love.

I loved the creative freedom programming gave me, there was a magic to it just like the magic that transformed a plain piece of paper into a fantastic creature. But there was more - I could do more, create more, entertain more, help more with programming than any of my other crafts or skills. The more society has move into the computer age the more I could do with programming. I could touch lives in new ways from productivity boosts at work to entertainment in the evenings with games for them and their children. While taking a required Quick Basic course in collage after finishing the current lesson I was writing AI for TIE Fighters and Proton Torpedoes for an X-wing flight simulator with graphics that were rendered pregame.

I have many, many ideas and a great many experiences; now I'm looking for a group of people with which to share those talents.

Maybe it's you ...

The business unit I was in at Conduent was sold off to Avenu Insights & Analytics. My responsibilities have continued as they were as the technical lead for the Court Case Management product.

I also helped with integrating a CMS (Umbraco) into a product portal that makes extensive use of the API for portal UI plug-ins. I was also responsible for creating installers and a Continuous Integration setup for deploying and testing the solution. Some of the challenges with the CI and deployment strategies were in creating a plug-in system for both the API and the Umbraco portal so clients could install only the parts they needed. This involved:  
-   maintaining multiple instances of the Umbraco portal and API for our development needs.
-   Creating a framework in Umbraco to allow easy and consistent bootstrapping of web apps.
-   Managing Umbraco packages for installing the needed framework.
